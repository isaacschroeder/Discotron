A disc golf score tracking application for android devices by Isaac Schroeder.

Project started:        4/18/21
Migrated to github:     8/31/21

This is my first major project, it uses vanilla android with a 3rd party library called Objectbox for persisting data (document based db).
I have learned alot about android development and project design/planning through the creation process.
I enjoy the debugging process because I have to play some disc golf to test the apps functions.
